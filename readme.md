# GitQuick4Bash
A simple Bash script with functions that speed up working with git (for me).

## Use
Clone the repo into an appropriate folder on your Mac of Linux machine, then source the file during bash shell start.  
Example for Mac: Add `source ~/scripts/GitQuick4Bash/gitQuick4Bash.sh` to your ~/.bash_profile file
